# Living Curriculum â€” Integrated Physics & Mathematics Roadmap (self-study, Free Resources)

*(GitHub-ready version with Pi setup and study sprint)*

---

## ðŸŒŒ Overview
A fully integrated, self-guided roadmap in physics, mathematics, and computation â€” optimized for **free learning**, **practical integration**, and **Raspberry Pi compatibility**. Designed for independent learners preparing for **astrophysics and theoretical physics** without formal tuition.

## ðŸ”§ Study Workflow
1. Each stage has: *Readings â†’ Notes â†’ Projects â†’ Reflections â†’ Integrations*.
2. Every math concept is paired with a physical phenomenon to model.
3. Use Git + Markdown for note-taking and documentation.
4. Publish results and projects openly (GitHub Pages or Notion).
